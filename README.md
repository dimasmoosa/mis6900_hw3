# mis6900_hw3

Development workflows
=======================

The layout of this project was from the cookiecutter template set up by running the following command (after doing a pip install of cookiecutter of course):

```bash
cookiecutter gh:misken/cookiecutter-datascience-simple
```

It has been modified a bit.
